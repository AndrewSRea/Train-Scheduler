# Train-Scheduler

https://andrewsrea.github.io/Train-Scheduler/index.html

A train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. This app will retrieve and manipulate this information with Moment.js. This website will provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.

When trains are added to this app, the following will be submitted to the Train Schedule:

Train Name

Destination

First Train Time -- in military time

Frequency -- in minutes

Users will be able to see when the next train will arrive, relative to the current time.

Have fun! CHOO CHOO!!
